# üìñ Description

Use this really sweet little API to log the reserves, states, and their subsequent pairs in a SQL database. Simply GET and POST to this API to transfer information. Authorization is held in a Bearer Key - more details below! 

# ü¶† Known Bugs

- Join table can be tricky at times. 

# üõ† Built With

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-3.1)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/)
- [Entity Framework Core 2.2.6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/)

# Getting Started

## Install .NET Core

- On macOS Mojave or later
  - [Click here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.2.106-macos-x64-installer) to download the .NET Core SDK from Microsoft Corp for macOS.
- On Windows 10 x64 or later
  - [Click here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.2.203-windows-x64-installer) to download the 64-bit .NET Core SDK from Microsoft Corp for Windows.

## Install dotnet script

Enter the command `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script` in Terminal for macOS or PowerShell for Windows.

## Install MySQL Workbench

[Download and install the appropriate version of MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).

## Code Editor

To view or edit the code, you will need an code editor or text editor. The popular open-source choices for an code editor are Atom and VisualStudio Code.

1. Code Editor Download:
   - Option 1: [Atom](https://nodejs.org/en/)
   - Option 2: [VisualStudio Code](https://www.npmjs.com/)
2. Click the download most applicable to your OS and system.
3. Wait for download to complete, then install -- Windows will run the setup exe and macOS will drag and drop into applications.
4. Optionally, create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com)

## Database Settings

1. Create a new file in the NationalParks directory named `appsettings.json`
2. Add in the following code snippet to the new appsettings.json file:

```
{
  "Logging": {
      "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning"
      }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=national_parks0;uid=root;pwd=YourPassword;"
  }
}
```

3. Change the server, port, and user id as necessary. Replace 'YourPassword' with relevant MySQL password (set at installation of MySQL).

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Use

- copy the repository URL and paste it after this GIT command `git clone {repository url}`
- after opening the repository in your code reader, run `dotnet build`
- once build is complete and no errors are thrown, run `dotnet watch run` in the terminal
- in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), paste this in the "request" line `http://localhost:4000/users/authenticate`
- change the request action to POST and copy this text into the body 

  ```
  {
    "username":"test",
    "password":"test"
  }
  ```
- copy the Bearer Token received in the body of the return and paste into your client
- POST or GET to `http://localhost:4000/api/reserves` or `http://localhost:4000/api/states`

# POSTING 

- in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or other client, paste your Bearer Token into a header
- paste this url into the request line -- http://localhost/api/{reserves OR states}
- to POST in RESERVES, paste this syntax into the body of your POST 

```
{
  "reserveName": "{the name of the reserve you are posting}"
  "states": "{states they currently reside in.}"
}
```
- for STATES
```
{
  "stateName": "{the name of the state you are posting}"
  "reserves": "{reserves currently in this state}"
}
```

# GETTING
- in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or other client, paste your Bearer Token into a header
- paste this url into the request line -- http://localhost/api/{reserves OR states}
- send request and reap the benefits of this incredible API!


## Database

1. Navigate to the NationalParksApi directory using the MacOS Terminal or Windows Powershell
2. Run the command `dotnet ef database update` to generate the database through Entity Framework Core.
3. (Optional) To update the database with any changes to the code, run the command `dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationsName>` which will use Entity Framework Core's code-first principle to generate a database update. After, run the previous command `dotnet ef database update` to update the database.
